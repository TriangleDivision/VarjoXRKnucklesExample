# VarjoXRKnucklesExample

The following example shows how to set-up a demo scene using the default Unity HDRP example environment, adding the Varjo XR plug-in for Unity, and adding the SteamVR plug-in with XR management support for Knuckles controls.

This Template uses the **High Definition Render Pipeline** (HDRP) and the new Unity XR management system.

The SteamVR plug-in will provide you with the latest 3d model and skeleton controls for displaying a visually rich hand model, complete with skeletal animation matching the users hold of the Knuckles controller.  Valve has updated their SteamVR plug-in to support the XR management API.  Note that the SteamVR plug-in is NOT required for normal Varjo HMD support; this is only to utilize the models, animations and scripting that has been created by Valve for the Knuckles controllers.

The Varjo XR plug-in is located here: https://github.com/varjocom/VarjoUnityXRPlugin
